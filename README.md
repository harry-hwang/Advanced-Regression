# Advanced Regression Project

#### Hi! The reason I do this porject is to test my skills and also try to practice some regression methods I've learned(I need to keep practicing so I won't forget the knowledge I've learned). The detail is down below.

## Dataset
I got the dataset from Kaggle (an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners). 

This one is about Airbnb data in New York city. 

The link is down below:

## Proccess

I import the data(data description included) and do some exploratory analysis first. I also do some data visualization to have more understanding of the data.

## Models

**1. Linear Regression** 
**2. Ridge Regression**
**3. Lasso Regression**
**4. Polynomial Regression**
**5. SVM regression (linear)**
**6. SVM regression (RBF)**
**7. KNN regressor**

#### End

This wraped up my practice, hope it hlped you guys, thank you very much.
